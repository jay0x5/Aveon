# NEW IPFS IMPLEMENTATION IN WORKS!

# We will be launching the documentation for usage asap by this weekend :)

# Follow our [github](https://github.com/jay0x5/Aveon) & [twitter](https://twitter.com/AveonJS) to keep up with latest updates about development :D


if you notice one security +1 here, Lets say there is a user "Nathan" and lets suppose a hacker wants to tamper his data and display it incorrectly on some xyz social network which uses aveonfs, lets assume he/she has access to his data and all, and that hacker updates his name to MrClown and makes his friends to 0, but do you realize even though that hacker did this and pushed it to ipfs network, it wont have any effect to Nathan's profile on xyz.com? Since Aveonfs backend only shows the user what their CAT/URK/MDTs have to show, in a nutshell, for hacker to actually make the desirable changes to be displayed on Nathan's profile on xyz.com would have to change Nathan's CAT/URK/MDT in his device to actually achieve the change on xyz.com which is highly unlikely since Nathan is a geek and leaves no loose ends :D Always keep your phone/ other devices secure kids!
