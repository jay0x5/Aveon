## Aveon NPM Package Walkthrough

 [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Aveon-Community/Aveon-Chat-Help.svg)](https://gitter.im/Aveon-Community/Aveon-Chat-Help?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

 
## WARNING:The current codebase of this package which is a GUNDB based implementation will be deprecated soon due to some complications with Gundb peers.Our team is building the IPFS implementation of Aveon which will be released soon!! Follow our [twitter](https://twitter.com/AveonJS) for latest updates about project.
## What is this?
- Aveon is an open sourced,decentralized DataBase & Secure Auth provider for Web3 Development.
- Based on GunDB, Aveon aims to provide goodness of decentralization and high security with minimal code setup for authentication purposes like Register,Login,etc.

## Purpose of this?
 - The purpose of starting this project is to apply the concept of decentralization without actually using complex blockchains and solidity and stuff,To study decentralization and speculate the capacity of P2P networks and of course to provide a tool with better security than standard databases like MySql,MongoDb,etc.

 - Basically to speculate if an easier and highly secure counterpart of blockchain is possible or not?


## How to use??

### Its super easy to use this package :D

#### 1. Step1: ```npm i aveon```

#### 2. Step2: ```Checkout our code snippets below to understand the code usage```


## Code Examples

#### Note: At the moment we have Basic Auth functions like Register,Login,Update and we will soon release functions for storing user relations.

## Warning[PLEASE READ!]:</br>
- All the parameters in example code snippets were specifically generated for example showcase and are not meant to be used in production by developer.

- Parameters like CAT,URK,MDT are generated by RegisterFunction but parameters like UUID and parameter to cut UUID from x to y is supposed to de decided by the developer using the package.
- It is strictly advised to follow the Instructions mentioned in the Parameters section of each snippet otherwise contact the developer team via Issues on Github or by mail if you have any doubts or queries regarding anything.


## **_How to Register??_**

```js


const aveon = require('aveon') 

const username = "testuserbyjay"
const password = "passwordbyjay"
const mail = "mailbyjay"
const uuid = 'uuidbyjay12d12d2d12dh182d9129d2udzd129dz20d29dd'
const cutuuidfrom = 2 
const cutuuidto = 31 
const recoverysecret = "recoverysecretbyjay"


var RegisterVariable = aveon.RegisterUser(username,password,mail,uuid,cutuuidfrom,cutuuidto,recoverysecret)

RegisterData = RegisterVariable.then(x=>
    {
        console.log(x)   
    })

//BOOM! registeration of user done right there!!!
```

### Code-Explanation =>

- Firstly we are importing/requiring the aveon package
- Then we set some parameter variables which are supposed to be passed to the Register Function.Lets understand what parameters are being passed to the function and why?

#### Parameters to be given to Register Function:

1.**Username**,**Password**,**Mail**: I hope you all know why these 3 are important.

2.**UUID**: UUID is basically anything which uniquely identifies a user, in case of apps which have access to system information UUID can be Hardware UUID and for websites it can be a secret phase into the code or as a environment variable set by developer and a part of which will be used as a key for encrypting their CAT(ClientAccessToken). The part to be used as a key is determined by the developer using the package.

3.**CutUUIDFrom**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding from which index to begin UUID slicing.

4.**CutUUIDTo**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding till which index the UUID should be sliced.

5.**RecoverySecret**: Just a secret phrase or key to be given by the developer which will be mixed with arbitary generation of each user's recovery document and URK(UserRecoveryKey).

- Parameters All Set!

- Now what we gonna do is set a variable to our RegisterUser function,pass the parameters in proper sequence to the function and then add a ```.then``` block to the variable to receive the returned promise which includes CAT,URK and MDT. The developer is expected to send both of these to the frontend.

- Just make it clear CAT to be stored on user's side.

- URK and MDT are supposed to be stored securely by user just like secret phrase keys.

- Registeration all done HAHA!



## **_How to Login??_**

```js
const aveon = require('aveon')

const EncCAT = "U2FsdGVkX192A5+OVJGvng/yyuYopvBHaVP26kfQ0VVww6YoaCcc1DN3oYtg2lBsX5k2ErysvjGf5wD/WFocbifnDViXig9fpZ1pjtfLTPwwg1cFhlmIhGAxedrMpwXG"

const cutuuidfrom = 2 
const cutuuidto = 31 

const Loginvariable = aveon.Loginuser(EncCAT,UUID,cutuuidfrom,cutuuidto)

LoginData = Loginvariable.then(u=>{

    //console.log(u)
    console.log("Logged in: " + u.LoggedinAs) // Logged in as testusernamebyjay

## **_How to Delete User Document?_**

- Deleting a user document works a bit differently when it comes to Aveon, the backend will simply set the username and other fields as null which would indicate that the user document has been deleted on the network.

#### DeleteUser Example:
```js
const aveon = require("aveon")

const encat = "U2FsdGVkX18RwW3XquEpiGO0vGRvwdQBjIKumevo6/AHwPzrF/OMqKB9+PonIf+7tgJFv2jC1lP9IYEbX49CEDHiWK/MPUiNq6DywPperM/EwvQcIlcB4Bk988bkA6KY"

const UUID = "uuidbyjay12d12d2d12dh182d9129d2udzd129dz20d29dd"

const CUTUUIDFROM = 2

const CUTUUIDTO = 31
var var1 = aveon.DeleteUser(encat,UUID,CUTUUIDFROM,CUTUUIDTO)

result = var1.then(x=>{
    console.log(x)
})
```
#### Parameters to be given to the DeleteUser function

1. **encat**: encat is basically Encrypted CAT which we stored on user's side during Registeration process.

2. **UUID**:  UUID is basically anything which uniquely identifies a user, in case of apps which have access to system information UUID can be Hardware UUID and for websites it can be a secret phase into the code or as a environment variable set by developer and a part of which will be used as a key for encrypting their CAT(ClientAccessToken). The part to be used as a key is determined by the developer using the package.

3. **CutUUIDFrom**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding from which index to begin UUID slicing.

4. **CutUUIDTo**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding till which index the UUID should be sliced.

#### NOTE- Please make sure that UUID, CutUUIDFrom and CutUUIDTo parameter were same for a specific user during their registeration and login process.

- Parameters all set!

- username,password and mail will be set to null once the process is completed and will return null value when accessed.

- Now what we gonna do is set a variable to our AddUserRelations function,pass the parameters in proper sequence to the function and then add a ```.then``` block to the variable to receive the returned promise which includes a simple string message "User Deleted successfully!".

- User has been deleted!

- Developer can delete the CAT stored on user's side after user's deletion request.




## **_How to Add/Fetch User Relations??_**

- In case with Aveon, User Relations are defined as every single property linked to a single user on the social network of developer who is developing with Aveon package.

- For example: User's About me, User's Profile Picture, User's friend list or following list,etc

- With Aveon, developer has freedom to put in any user relation of their choice by simply creating a json object of the relation and passing it to the method. Lets take a look at Adding Relations below

#### Add Relations

```js
const aveon = require('aveon')

const RelationsObj = {UserPfp: "pfpPOGGIES",Userbio: "bioXD",UserFollowings: "FOLLOWING SHEESH"}

const EncCat = "U2FsdGVkX1+V3qcqmv7fyqwgDsgshuar45mMiaHR61wuTlyxoJ7L7YPGiw365d294FskLKVXpixLsgIgAOPOLCWpK+osU9nfPEAyea7QY0izvZr1ujJt+LdbAngIWVkg"
const uuid = 'uuidbyjay12d12d2d12dh182d9129d2udzd129dz20d29dd'
const cutuuidfrom = 2
const cutuuidto = 31

const addrel = aveon.AddUserRelations(RelationsObj,EncCat,uuid,cutuuidfrom,cutuuidto)

addedresult = addrel.then(x=>{console.log(x)})

console.log(addedresult)
```
#### Parameters to be given to AddUserRelations Function:

1. **RelationsObj**: Basically all user relations which I am storing in above example with a specific user like user's pfp reference, user's bio and user's following and I hope you all can notice that I or anyone using this package as a developer has freedom to put any form of user relation within the object and then pass that whole object to add function.

2. **EncCat**: EncCat is basically Encrypted CAT which we stored on user's side during Registeration process.

3. **uuid**:  UUID is basically anything which uniquely identifies a user, in case of apps which have access to system information UUID can be Hardware UUID and for websites it can be a secret phase into the code or as a environment variable set by developer and a part of which will be used as a key for encrypting their CAT(ClientAccessToken). The part to be used as a key is determined by the developer using the package.

4. **CutUUIDFrom**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding from which index to begin UUID slicing.

5. **CutUUIDTo**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding till which index the UUID should be sliced.

#### NOTE- Please make sure that UUID, CutUUIDFrom and CutUUIDTo parameter were same for a specific user during their registeration and login process.

- Parameters all set!

- Now what we gonna do is set a variable to our AddUserRelations function,pass the parameters in proper sequence to the function and then add a ```.then``` block to the variable to receive the returned promise which includes a simple string message "Added passed user relations".

- user-relations added!Cheers!


#### Fetch Relations

const uuid = 'uuidbyjay12d12d2d12dh182d9129d2udzd129dz20d29dd'

const fetchdata = aveon.FetchUserRelations(cat,uuid,2,31)

fetchedresult = fetchdata.then(x=>{console.log(x)})
console.log(fetchedresult)
```
#### Parameters to be given to FetchUserRelations Function:

1. **EncCat**: EncCat is basically Encrypted CAT which we stored on user's side during Registeration process.

2. **uuid**:  UUID is basically anything which uniquely identifies a user, in case of apps which have access to system information UUID can be Hardware UUID and for websites it can be a secret phase into the code or as a environment variable set by developer and a part of which will be used as a key for encrypting their CAT(ClientAccessToken). The part to be used as a key is determined by the developer using the package.

3. **CutUUIDFrom**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding from which index to begin UUID slicing.

4. **CutUUIDTo**: The parameter to be given by the developer for deciding till which index the UUID should be sliced.

#### NOTE- Please make sure that UUID, CutUUIDFrom and CutUUIDTo parameter were same for a specific user during their registeration and login process.

- Parameters all set!

- Now what we gonna do is set a variable to our AddUserRelations function,pass the parameters in proper sequence to the function and then add a ```.then``` block to the variable to receive the returned promise which includes the user relations object which was added with the help of add function.

- user-relations fetched! It is simple as that :D


## **_How to store any type of data?_**

- Apart from Secure Auth abilities,Aveon also provides the developer with an option to store whatever they wish to in form of JSON Object.

- We are still planning out this feature and will be rolled out soon!</br>Stay Tuned to our [twitter](https://twitter.com/AveonJS?s=20&t=VthMNi8g5QVt0egC8Y_q1g) or our [mail](contactaveon@gmail.com) us your questions :D

<!-- **Example**:
